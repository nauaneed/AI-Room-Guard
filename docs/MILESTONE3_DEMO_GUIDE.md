### 🔊 Audio Integration
- **Real-time TTS**: Hear actual spoken responses
- **Level-appropriate Voice**: Tone changes with escalation level
- **Performance Optimized**: <2 second conversion time
- **Quality Audio**: Clear, natural-sounding speech

## Demo Output Examples

### Escalation Progression Example
```
🎬 Conversation started with uncooperative_demo
💭 Generated: "Hello, I don't recognize you. Could you please identify yourself?"
🔊 Spoken: "Hello, I don't recognize you. Could you please identify yourself?"

👤 Person (Step 1): "What? Who are you to ask me that?"
🧠 Analysis: continue_conversation (neutral response)
📊 Current escalation level: 1

👤 Person (Step 2): "None of your business! I can be here if I want."
🧠 Analysis: escalate (uncooperative response)
📈 Escalated to Level 2 (uncooperative)
💭 Generated: "Please state your business here or leave the premises immediately."
🔊 Spoken: "Please state your business here or leave the premises immediately."

...continues through Level 4...
```

### Performance Metrics Example
```
📊 Performance Test Results:
   Response generation time: 0.003s ✅
   TTS conversion time: 0.847s ✅
   Total end-to-end time: 2.134s ✅
   Average escalation decision time: 0.001s ✅
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Demonstrated
- **Modular Design**: Each component (LLM, TTS, Escalation) works independently
- **Event-Driven**: Callback system for real-time monitoring
- **Threaded Execution**: Non-blocking conversation management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and async processing

### Integration Points Shown
- **LLM ↔ Escalation Manager**: Context-aware response generation
- **Response Generator ↔ TTS**: Seamless text-to-speech conversion
- **Conversation Controller ↔ All Components**: Orchestrated workflow
- **Event System**: Real-time monitoring and logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Audio Output
- **Check**: Speakers/headphones connected and volume up
- **Fix**: System will still show text responses and continue demonstration

#### Slow Performance
- **Cause**: First TTS conversion may be slower due to initialization
- **Normal**: Subsequent conversions should be <2 seconds

#### Missing LLM Responses
- **Expected**: Demo uses fallback responses when GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY not set
- **Impact**: Responses are still intelligent and appropriate, just pre-defined

#### Permission Errors
- **Check**: Run from project root directory
- **Fix**: Ensure proper file permissions with `chmod +x milestone3_demo.py`

### System Status Indicators
- **✅ Available**: Component fully functional
- **⚠️ Using fallbacks**: Component working with reduced functionality
- **❌ Not Available**: Component not functional (demo will skip related features)

## Demo Best Practices

### For Presenters
1. **Start with Automated Demo** for overview
2. **Use Interactive Demo** for detailed explanation
3. **Enable audio** for full experience
4. **Explain escalation logic** as levels progress
5. **Show performance metrics** to demonstrate real-time capability

### For Evaluators
1. **Test different scenarios** to understand system behavior
2. **Pay attention to timing** and escalation logic
3. **Listen to audio quality** and naturalness
4. **Check performance metrics** for real-time suitability
5. **Try custom responses** to test adaptability

### For Developers
1. **Monitor event callbacks** to understand system flow
2. **Check performance metrics** for optimization opportunities
3. **Test error conditions** by disabling components
4. **Examine response variation** across multiple runs
5. **Validate audio pipeline** end-to-end
