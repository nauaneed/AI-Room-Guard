5.4. Add timeout handling for non-responsive intruders
5.5. Integrate with existing face recognition results

**Deliverable:** Complete conversation system with audio input/output
**Test:** Simulate full conversation cycle with escalation

### Step 6: Integration with Existing System (35 minutes)
**Objective:** Integrate dialogue system with existing face recognition and response system

**Tasks:**
6.1. Modify `ResponseSystem` to use new dialogue capabilities
6.2. Update recognition event handling to trigger conversations
6.3. Integrate escalation system with trust management
6.4. Add dialogue state to system state management
6.5. Update logging to include conversation events
6.6. Ensure proper cleanup and state reset

**Deliverable:** Fully integrated system with dialogue capabilities
**Test:** Complete end-to-end flow from face detection to escalated conversation

### Step 7: Enhanced Error Handling and Edge Cases (25 minutes)
**Objective:** Implement robust error handling for dialogue system

**Tasks:**
